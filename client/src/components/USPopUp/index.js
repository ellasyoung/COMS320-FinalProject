        <Blurb>
        The United States is a significant producer of silica, a key material used in the production of iPhone glass screens and semiconductor components. Extracted primarily from quartz sand, silica is refined into high-purity silicon, which forms the foundation for advanced electronics. The U.S. mining sector is central to the tech supply chain, but silica mining raises environmental and health concerns, particularly related to land use and worker safety.
