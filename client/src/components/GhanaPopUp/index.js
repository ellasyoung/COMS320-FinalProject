        Agbogbloshie, Ghana, is one of the worldâ€™s largest e-waste dumps, where discarded electronics, including outdated iPhones, end up. These devices, shipped from high-income countries, are dismantled in hazardous conditions by informal workers. Agbogbloshie has become a symbol of global environmental injustice, revealing the hidden costs of the digital age.
